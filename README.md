# Modbus Database

Welcome to the **Modbus Database**! This repository is a comprehensive collection of Modbus tables from various manufacturers. The goal is to streamline any project that requires Modbus communication by providing a one-stop resource for Modbus maps. No more manual searching and writing of Modbus maps - we've got you covered!

## Devices

| Manufacturer | Model | Industry | Application |
|--------------|-------|----------|-------------|
| **[BTicino](modbus-tables/BTicino)** | [F4N200](modbus-tables/BTicino/F4N200) | Energy | Energy Metering |

## Usage

To leverage our Modbus tables in your project, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `modbus-tables` directory or simply click on the manufacturer's link in the [Devices](#devices) table.
2. Choose the manufacturer and model subdirectory that matches your needs.
3. Download the table file and integrate it into your project.

Remember, each table is stored in a separate subdirectory under its respective manufacturer and model. Different versions (like v1, v2, v3, etc.) for each model are also present, and you'll always find a 'latest' folder for the most recent version.
